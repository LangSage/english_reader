      After the bell test, Team 7 starts simple missions in the village. Naruto hates
      catching cats and doing boring jobs. He wants a real adventure. One day, they get
      a bigger mission: they must protect a bridge builder from the Land of Waves.
    </p>

      Naruto is very excited, because it is their first mission outside the village.
      The client, an old man named Tazuna, drinks a lot and thinks the team is too weak.
      On the road, two enemy ninja attack them. Naruto is scared and cannot move at
      first, but then he fights to protect his friends and the client.

      Later, a famous missing ninja appears. His name is Zabuza. He uses a huge sword
      and covers the area with thick mist. Kakashi protects the team and uses his
      Sharingan eye. For Naruto, this is the first time he sees a real battle between
      strong ninja, not just training at the academy.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the bridge, the fight becomes even harder. Zabuza and his partner Haku are
      enemies, but they also have their own pain and dreams. Naruto learns that a ninja’s
      life is not only about power and missions. It is also about choices, loss, and
      protecting people who are important to you.
