      After the academy, Naruto joins his first ninja team. The team is called Team 7.
      It has three students: Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura, and one sensei, Kakashi.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sasuke is quiet and very talented. Sakura is smart and cares a lot about him.
      Naruto is noisy but honest. They are very different, so working together is not easy at first.
    </p>

    <p>
      Their first big lesson with Kakashi is the bell test. Kakashi has two small bells.
      The main rule sounds simple: only two students who get a bell will pass, and one will fail.
      But the real goal is teamwork.
    </p>

    <p>
      At first, each student attacks alone. Naruto uses a clone.
      Kakashi uses illusion techniques and traps. In the end they learn to share their lunch and
      help each other, even when it breaks the rule. Kakashi finally smiles and says they pass,
      because they chose their friends over the mission.
